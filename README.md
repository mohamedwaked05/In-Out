3.  **Start the Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```
    *or if using local Composer:*

    ```

5.  **Generate the application key:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Run database migrations & seeders:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
    ```

7.  **Visit the application:**
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost`.

## üë• Default Users

After seeding, the following test users are created:

1.  **Manager Account:**
    -   **Email:** manager@example.com

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Key Tables:
-   **`users`:** Stores all users (employees and managers). Managers have a `null` `manager_id`.
-   **`attendance_records`:** Stores each check-in/out event with a timestamp and photo path.
-   **`notifications`:** Stores in-app notifications for managers.

### Relationships:
-   A `User` (manager) `hasMany` `User` (employees).
-   An `Employee` `belongsTo` a `User` (manager).
-   A `User` `hasMany` `AttendanceRecord`s.
-   An `AttendanceRecord` `belongsTo` a `User`.
